                Ingredients
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flour</strong>  
                <p>
                    All-purpose flour contains gluten, which gives the buttermilk pancakes structure and pleasant chewiness. 
                </p></li>
                <li><strong>Salt</strong>  
                    <p>You definitely don't want to skip adding a small amount of salt â€” the buttermilk pancakes will taste bland without it. 
                    </p></li>
                <li><strong>Buttermilk</strong>  
                <p>
                    Of course, you'll need buttermilk for buttermilk pancakes! This recipe calls for three whole cups. 
                </p></li>
                <li><strong>Eggs</strong>  
                    <p>
                        Three whole eggs add structure and rich flavor to the buttermilk pancakes 
                    </p></li>
                <li><strong>Butter</strong>  
                <p>
                    Melted butter lends flavor and keeps the pancakes nice and moist. 
                </p></li>
                <li><strong>Sugar</strong>  
                    <p>
                        Just three tablespooons of white sugar should be enough to lend subtle sweetness. Remember, you'll be adding a lot more sugar if you top the pancakes with syrup or molasses! 
                    </p></li>
                <li><strong>Leavaners</strong>  
                <p>
                    Baking powder and baking soda act as leaveners (a substance that releases gas when mixed with other ingredients, causing the bater to rise to fluffy perfection) 
                </p></li>
                <li><strong>Milk</strong>  
                    <p>
                       Whole milk helps create the perfect batter consistency and cuts some of the buttermilk's acidity.
                    </p></li>                   
            </ul>

                Steps
            </h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Mix Dry Ingredients</strong>
                    <p>
                        Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. 
                    </p> </li>
                 <li><strong>Mix Wet Ingredients</strong>
                    <p>
                        Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.                        
                    </p> </li>
                    <li><strong> Make the pancakes</strong>
                        <p>
                            Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.                                                </p> </li>                
            </ol>
